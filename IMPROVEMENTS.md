# CRT Trading System Improvements

## Latest Improvements (July 2025)
We've made several significant improvements to the CRT (Candle Range Theory) trading system to address issues with take profits being too far away and to implement a proper sequential trading approach. Here's a comprehensive list of the latest changes:

## Take Profit Optimization
- Reduced TP1 from 1:1 to 0.65:1 risk-reward ratio
- Reduced TP2 from 2:1 to 1.3:1 risk-reward ratio
- Adjusted minimum required risk-reward from 1.0 to 0.65

## Stop Loss Optimization
- Reduced SL_BUFFER from 30.0 to 20.0
- Reduced MIN_SL_DISTANCE from 20.0 to 15.0
- Reduced ATR multiplier from 1.5x to 1.2x

## Sequential Trading Implementation
- Added check for existing open positions before taking new trades
- Enhanced trade lock that only releases when positions close
- Added explicit tracking of daily trade count (maximum 3 per day)
- Added status display showing current trading conditions

## Code Improvements
- Fixed indentation problems and syntax errors
- Enhanced error handling in critical sections
- Improved trade completion tracking and reporting
- Added better position management notifications

## Previous Improvements
We've also made several significant improvements to the CRT trading system in earlier updates to fix the issues with stop-loss distances and multiple simultaneous trades. Here's a comprehensive list of those changes:

## 1. Timeframe Adjustments
- Changed the range timeframe from H1 to D1 for better range analysis
- Changed the entry timeframe from M5 to H1 for more meaningful entries
- This provides wider, more appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels for gold trading

## 2. Stop-Loss Improvements
- Increased the SL_BUFFER from a small value to 30.0 (30 USD for gold)
- Set a minimum SL distance of 20.0 for gold trading
- Implemented ATR-based dynamic stop-loss calculation for market volatility awareness
- Fixed SL placement logic to ensure stops are properly distanced from entry price

## 3. Risk Management Enhancements
- Added a proper trade lock mechanism to prevent multiple entries on the same signal
- Implemented a cooldown period (now 240 minutes) after each trade
- Added release_lock_after_cooldown() to automatically release the trade lock after cooldown
- Enhanced R:R calculation to use dynamic ATR-based levels instead of fixed levels

## 4. Error Handling & Robustness
- Added comprehensive error handling for the "Invalid stops" (10016) error
- Implemented a fallback mechanism with larger stop distances if initial order fails
- Added alternative order placement approach (place without SL/TP, then add them)
- Fixed indentation and code structure issues throughout the file

## 5. Trade Monitoring
- Enhanced the TP1 hit detection to move SL to breakeven for TP2
- Added more detailed logging for better trade analysis
- Used threading for background monitoring without blocking the main loop

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor the first few trades closely to ensure stop-loss distances are appropriate
2. Verify the system doesn't place multiple trades for the same signal
3. Check that TP1/TP2 levels are properly calculated based on ATR values
4. Confirm that SL moves to breakeven properly when TP1 is hit

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a trailing stop feature for TP2 positions
- Implement a detailed trade statistics tracker
- Add visualization of entry/exit points on a chart
- Consider a more sophisticated news filter with impact scoring

These changes should result in a much more robust trading system with appropriate stop-loss distances for gold trading using the D1/H1 timeframe combination. The stop-loss distances are now dynamically calculated based on market volatility (ATR) and have appropriate minimum distances to avoid premature stop-outs.
